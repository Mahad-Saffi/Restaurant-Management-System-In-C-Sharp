The functionalities described in your note have been distributed among these roles and their supporting systems. This structuring respects the principles of encapsulation by keeping related functionalities within each class, inheritance by deriving different user types from a base User class, and polymorphism by allowing different types of users to perform similar actions in different ways (e.g., placing an order online or offline). Abstraction is used by creating interfaces or abstract classes for common functionalities that can be extended or implemented by concrete classes.
